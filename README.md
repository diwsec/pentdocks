# why should you use it

Usually, people who have one laptop face problems when multitasking. While pentesting, I used to install and run `VMware` in ubuntu to run other tools to finish my work faster. So i found a way to solve this using docker and I fell in love with it. The most amazing thing that i'm fascinated about is that the docker is just like an `OS`, internally running. You can keep backups using `sudo docker save os:latest > os.tar` and many more. just try it, you will love it.

[download and install docker from here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script).
> install-using-the-convenience-script to make the installation process simple.

# installation

install ubuntu image in docker
```
sudo docker pull ubuntu
```
run the image

```
sudo docker run -it --name pentest ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
```
To run the script in docker, you need some requirements
```
apt-get -y update && apt-get -y dist-upgrade && apt-get -y autoremove && apt-get -y autoclean
```
```
apt-get install -y git
```

```
apt-get install -y golang
```

Now open `.bashrc` for exporting the following environment variables
 
type this in terminal(use any editors)

```
vim ~/.bashrc
```
```
export GOPATH=/home/$USER/go
```
```
export PATH=${PATH}:$GOROOT/bin:/home/$USER/go/bin
```

These changes will take effect after a reboot. Instead of restarting, run 
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

If you are not sure which shell you have, then run the command 
```
echo $SHELL
```
If it displays: `/bin/bash` – means you have Bash

now clone my repo `https://github.com/diwusec/pentdocks.git` and `cd pentdocks` directory to run `bash docker.sh` for installing the tools

after the installation exit from the docker

> to start the docker again run the container not the image

```
sudo docker exec -it pentest /bin/bash
```
# happy hacking!
